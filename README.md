# Multilevel_Inheritance

# brief details of the project

In these proj I have made a example of Multilevel Inheritance where you can know find out the volume of a box.

I'm working in a wappnet system software company. And Jaldip sir told Me about a project to find out the volume of a box. You, the competent employee, completed this task by creating a simple Box class.

The next day, he told me to rewrite the program, adding weight as well. so I have created a child class, BoxWeight, and inherited the Box class.

again The next day, he told me to rewrite the program,and add Shipment details. i have created another class, Shipment, and inherited the BoxWeight class.
